               <h2>The Gym Problem</h2>
                    <p>Yeah I lift. What of it? Is that MY barbell weighing 225lbs sitting in front of me? Um...who else's would it be; I'm the only one standing here. Oh...I'm a woman...wow. You're right. Nice observational analysis there, my homie. I suppose women aren't supposed to be lifting such heavy objects, huh?</p>

                    <p>"Ma, no one wants to date me."</p>
                    <p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
                    <p>"Probably because I lift heavier than most guys out there :-("</p>
                    <p>"You have a point, my child"</p>
                    <p>Ma turns and looks me square in the eye, deep into my soul and says, <strong>"Lift. Heavier."</strong></p>
