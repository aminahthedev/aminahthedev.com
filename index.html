               <h2>The Gym Problem</h2>
                    <p>Yeah I lift. What of it? Is that MY barbell weighing 225lbs sitting in front of me? Um...who else's would it be; I'm the only one standing here. Oh...I'm a woman...wow. You're right. Nice observational analysis there, my homie. I suppose women aren't supposed to be lifting such heavy objects, huh?</p>

                    <p>"Ma, no one wants to date me."</p>
                    <p>"What makes you think that?"</p>
                    <p>"Probably because I lift heavier than most guys out there :-("</p>
                    <p>"You have a point, my child"</p>
                    <p>Ma turns and looks me square in the eye, deep into my soul and says, <strong>"Lift. Heavier."</strong></p>

               <h3>Bodybuilding Dot Com</h3>
               <p>The Bodybuilding website is very heavy with the javascript and many, many HTML elements such as:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Header</li>
                    <li>Script elements within divs, which likely link some javascript to that location within the html</li>
                    <li>They use a <strong>picture</strong> element</li>
                    <li>Lots of spans</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The website is pretty great! It's got lots of code, lots of interaction and style. It's also content rich, which makes it easier to build the html and engage users.</p>
